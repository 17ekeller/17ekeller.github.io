# **About Me**


## In the Beginning

I grew up in the Island Lake, IL, a small suburb 45 miles from downtown Chicago. From a young age I've always been interested in computers, particularly in understanding what makes them work. 

I had a creative side as well, launching many YouTube channels in my childhood (none exceedingly successful), from Clash of Clans content to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plLhBKygEVk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">snowboarding videos</a>, I had a wide variety of subject matter!

## Getting Older

During highschool I was a part of the Future Business Leaders of America organization holding the position of fundraising chair for my local chapter. In 2016 me and a team of two others took first place in the E-commerce website design category at the state competition. I credit this organization with teaching me invaluable presentation and business acumen skills. I was a part of the Baseball, Tennis and Cross Country teams as well.

## Moving Out

In 2017, I chose to attend the University of Iowa (Go Hawkeyes!). My first year at Iowa I was part of the residency program, where I worked about 30 hours per week in order to gain residency status for tution purposes. I'm proud with the way I managed my time between doing that program and handling schoolwork to help offset the high cost of attending University. 

Going into college I was on a business economics track. However, after realizing my true passion lies in computers and data, I switched majors my Sophomore year to Informatics - the study of computational information systems. Along the way I was part of a fraternity and held the year long leadership position of Recruitment Chairman with the responsibility to bring in new members. I graduated in 2022.

## As of Late

Currently I reside in Bartlett, IL a suburb 35 miles from downtown Chicago. I got engaged to my now fiancée in the fall of 2025 and we are planning our wedding for the spring of 2027! We live with our two year old cat, Maisy, who loves being the center of attention...

My free time is filled with golfing, snowboarding and cooking (always looking for new and exciting dishes to make). I love spending time with my friends, especially when a beer or two is involved, and my family. I'm a lifelong Bears fan and thrilled about their recent performance! I've also gotten back into running and have a personal goal to focus on my health and physical well being more than ever in 2026.
